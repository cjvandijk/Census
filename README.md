# US Census Analysis

For this project, I analyzed a dataset from a marketing study done in San Francisco as part of a course in uring Python for data science.
The dataset had 8 columns, both with categorical and continuous data. Sadly, I do not have the original data file that was used (it was not downloadable). But the results are here in the notebook with my code.
